            justify to the

        He thus addressed him:
        <action ref="wolf">“Sirrah, last year you grossly insulted me.”</action>

            , “I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drink to me.”
        </action>
        Upon which the
        <character ref="wolf">Wolf</character>
        <action ref="wolf">seized him and ate him up</action>
